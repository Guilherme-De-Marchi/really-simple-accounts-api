# ACCOUNTS API
##### _I'm learning about apis and node.js:) _

** Run `index.js` in the main directory and go to `localhost: 8080 / `**.

To register an account, go to `localhost:8080 / account / register` and submit a post request with the following arguments:` username = your_username` and `password = your_password`.

Example: `username = BrksEdu`; `password = Biladeiro`

**NOTE**: Go to `localhost:8080/accounts/login` and submit a post request with any arguments to see the full database (I didn't build the login system lol)
